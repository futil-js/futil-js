A collection of F(unctional) Util(ities). Resistance is futile.

Mostly, these are generic utilities that could conceivably be part of a library like lodash/fp, but for some reason or other are not.

# Version History/Changelog
See our [changelog](https://github.com/smartprocure/futil-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

# Installing
`npm i -S futil-js`

This package require `lodash/fp`, so make sure that's available in your app.

# API

## Function

### maybeCall
`(fn, a, b) -> fn(a, b)`
Calls a function with the passed in arguments if it's a function

### overNone
`([f, g]) -> !f(x) && !g(x)`
Combinator that returns a function which will pass if none of the functions pass


## Collection

### flowMap
`...fns:functions -> map:function`
Runs a map function that runs a `flow` of the functions passed in to this method


## Lodash Conversions
These are conversions of lodash fp methods

### `In`s (Rearg False)
`getIn`, `includesIn`, `pickIn`
lodash/fp is great, but sometimes the curry order isn't exactly what you want.
These methods provide alternative orderings that are sometimes more convenient.
The idea of `In` methods is to name them by convention, so when ever you need a method that actually takes the collection first (e.g. a `get` where the data is static but the field is dynamic), you can just add `In` to the end (such as `getIn` which takes the object first)

### `On`s (Immutable False)
`extendOn`, `defaultsOn`
lodash/fp likes to keep things pure, but sometimes JS can get pretty dirty.
These methods are alternatives for working with data that--for whatever the use case is--needs to be mutable
Any methods that interact with mutable data will use the `On` convention (as it is some action occuring `On` some data)

## Array

### compactJoin
`join:string -> data:array -> result:string`
Joins an array after compacting

### dotJoin
`data:array -> result:string`
Compacts and joins an array with '.'

### repeated
`data:array -> result:array`
Returns an array of elements the are repeated in the array


## Object

### singleObject
`(k, v) -> {k: v}`
Creates an object with a key and value

### singleObjectE
`(v, k) -> {k: v}`
Flipped version of `singleObject`

### chunkObject
`({a, b}) -> [{a}, {b}]`
Breaks an object into an array of objects with one key each

### compactObject
Remove properties with falsey values: ({ a: 1, b: null, c: false }) -> {a:1}

### isEmptyObject
Check if it's a `{}`

### isNotEmptyObject
Check if it's not a `{}`

### stripEmptyObjects
`{ a:1, b:{}, c:2 } -> {a:1, c:2}`
Omit properties whose values are empty objects
(*TODO* remame to `omitEmptyObjects`)

### compareDeep
Checks if an object's property is equal to a value

### matchesSignature
Returns true if object keys are only elements from signature list (but does not require all signature keys to be present)

### pickInto
*TODO*

### renameProperty
`from:string -> to:string: -> target:object -> result:object`
Rename a property on an object
`renameProperty('a', 'b', {a:1}) -> {b:1)`

### unwind
`{ x:['a','b'], y:1 } -> [{ x:'a', y:1 }, { x:'b', y:1 }]`
Just like mongo's `$unwind`

### flattenObject
`{ a: { b: { c: 1 } } } => { 'a.b.c' : 1 }`
Flatten an object with the paths for keys

## String
### parens
`'asdf' -> '(asdf)'`
Wraps a string in parenthesis


## Misc

### testRegex
`regex -> string -> bool`
Just like rambda test, creates a function to test a regex on a string


## Math
### greaterThanOne
`number -> bool`
Returns true if number is greater than one
